# React JS practice

This is just for my personal practice. Fork it at your own cost. I might be using some practices that are not suitable, so please read the [License](https://github.com/prateekjadhwani/react-app-shell/blob/master/LICENSE) before you decide to use this project elsewhere.

###Installation

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies.

###Build Instructions

You will need to build the project before running. And I am using `webpack` to bundle everything.

```
webpack --watch
```

or simply

```
webpack
```

### Run Instructions

I used cloud9 to build this project. So I simply run the file `index.html` by selecting it and clicking on the `Run` button.

You can also use webpack's dev server and use hot reloading with it

```
webpack-dev-server
```

Or You can run it locally via the command

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
```
